                        With the growing number of Fintech applications out in the market aimed at encouraging saving from young Millenials with non actually suggesting how these young ones can cut cost,Digital Elites aims to shine the light on these grey areas based on insight gathered from the spending culture of these users.</p>
                        
                        <p>I served here as the sole product designer and it was a small team of 4 engineers and myself. I led the product,UX and UI strategy for the team. I've been extremely fortunate to have part of this journey and have grown tremendously during my time working on Digital Elites, some key achievements of which I have listed below:
                        <p>Turned an idea into a product. </p>
                        <p>The ability to transform an idea into something much more tangible is a process that is both exhilarating and rewarding.</p>
                        <p>Juggled many different hats. I developed skills in not only designing our pitches but also presenting them to management staff.
                       
                       <p><h3>Understanding the problem</h3></p>

                        As a university student, I understood the pains of not being able to save much due to low income flow. I wanted to validate these problems with peers so I took the initiative to Work with 13 random university students who were looking to save more and get cheaper deals.
                        After listening to these students we decided to design a product around them to help them save and give them daily insights into their spending habit as well as push discounted prices of their most frequent purchases daily.</p>  
                        
                        <h3>User personas</h3>
                        Based on our research, we recognised that there were 3 key user types that our product tried to solve problems for. We decided to focus on Persona 1 since their need was greatest and we could reach them via universities, bootcamps and education providers.
                        
                        
                        <h3> Defining the MVP</h3>

                        <p>I conducted workshops and sketching sessions with the team to map out the user flow and come up with a storyboard to capture the MVP.
                        </p>
                        We identified the following key features:
                        <p>Goal definition. Allow users to set a  goal and specify the level that they want to get to in that savings goal.
                        </p>
                      <p>List of recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Connecting with merchants.</p> 
                  <p>Tracking of development. View your progress over time to see how you are tracking towards your goal.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>Designs</h3>
                        User testing was an iterative process that was conducted at every milestone of the project to identify the biggest pain points in the current version. Once feedback was gathered, I would revisit the prototypes and test again.
                        ‍
                        For the brand, I wanted to create a refreshing, minimalist and clean UI that conveyed trustworthiness and progression for future-oriented individuals.
                        
                      <p>Sign up page
                        A simple sign up page that allow users to either log in or create a new account using email or phone number.
                      </p>
                    <p>Browse recommendations
                        Once users have established a goal, we show them a list of merchants on the app and how the discount works.
                      </p>
                    <p>Progress dashboard
                        As a user completes activities, they can view their progress towards their goal and see a breakdown of their savings so far.
                      <p>
                      <p>Profile
                        Ultimately the goal of Digital Elites is to provide jobseekers and employers with an interactive profile that goes beyond a resume. The idea to show a resume that is forward looking, rather than just a snapshot of their history, which illustrates the goals and development of the individual over time.
                      </p>
                    <p> Working with developers
                    </p>I worked closely with a team of 4 engineers to develop the designs for MVP. 
                        
                       
                        
                        <h3>Results and takeaways</h3>
                        Working in  startup was athe project was an extremely steep learning curve. It was an eye-opening experience that taught me a lot about being lean and knowing when and where to focus your energy and efforts.
                        ‍
                        Some key takeaways from this project are:
                        Focus on building an MVP. 
                        Don't worry too much about the detail. Earlier in my journey, I made the mistake of worrying about the look of the UI. Taking a step back and reassessing the user flows helped me to reprioritise the UX.
                        Focus on the problem. At the end of the day, it is your users pains that you will be solving for so keeping that front of mind is important as it's easy to lose sight of this when you're bogged down in the day to day.

                          The Server Monitoring app started with the vision of improving the efficiency of the GTBank developer portal, by improving the uptimes of the servers.
                          
                          The goal of this particular project was to identify any usability issues with the beta release and determine the critical features to prioritise for the next iteration of the product.

                          <h3>Background</h3>
           
                          I started as the product designer a year ago as one of 2 designers in a company of over 70 engineers and 15 product managers. I support design across every aspect of our business and am responsible for leading UX and UI across key parts of the application side of the platform.
                          I've grown tremendously in the last year, some key achievements of which I have listed below:
                          Implemented a design process. This has helped our team establish more structure to how we conduct our work and allow other teams to gain visibility across our upcoming sprints.
                          Improved usability across the platform. No usability tests were conducted by the external consultancy before dev handoff. Since we established a design team, we have been actively working towards conducting UX research and usability testing on all projects.
                          Establishing a design kit. This has helped to maintain consistency in the look and feel across different parts of the platform.  
                          Establishing a design system.  This has helped the Engineering and Product teams to understand how and why we choose to implement certain components over others.
                          
                          <h3>The process</h3>
                          <p>Our process at The Server Monitoring app is based on the Double Diamond Theory and Lean UX process. We aim to incorporate the key phases of Discovery, Definition, Ideation and Implementation in all of our projects.
                          </p>
                        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>

                        <p>The challenge here was to have an internal real time access to the states of the servers and take necessary actions when any is down</p>
                          ‍
                         My research encompassed:
                          Understanding the user goals and needs
                          Uncovering pain points with the existing user journey
                          Determining the success of the tasks measured
                          Gathering insights
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>After collecting the recordings from the user interviews, I conducted affinity mapping with my teammate to synthesise the pains identified. We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the platform.
                          </p>
                         <p> I relied on a data-driven approach known as the severity framework to inform my process and list usability issues in order of priority. The framework helps to identify the severity score of a usability issue based on the following three variables:
                          <div><p>Task criticality x impact x frequency = severity
                          <p>Task criticality - how important is the task to the user? (1 = low, 5 = critical)</p>
                          <p>Impact - how much of an impact does this issue have on the user's task? (1 = suggestion, 5 = blocker)</p>
                          <p>Frequency (%) - how many times does this come up out of total participants?</p></p></div>
                          </p>

                          <h3>Prioritisation of issues</h3>

                          <p>I took the extra step of categorising these problems into broader Epics to provide the Product managers and engineers with visibility into the key areas of the platform that needed to be addressed from a usability standpoint. This not only helped to prioritise usability issues in order of need but also helped to shape the product roadmap for the quarter.
                          ‍</p>
                          
                          <h3>Wireframing the solution</h3>

                          <p>Based on the above problems identified, I worked towards addressing these pains by coming up with potential solutions:
                          Reducing the number of steps to minimise time to completion
                          Surfacing mandatory fields and enabling the Next button to show error validation
                          Establishing clearer visual form hierarchy by grouping related fields
                          The lack of a formal wizard component also meant that I had to come up with a standardised styling and UI pattern for future wizards
                          I quickly mocked up some basic wireframes to gather feedback from Product, Engineering and the users on the overall layout and structure of the wizard form. This involved establishing a standardised visual hierarchy and layout for the future wizard component.
                          ‍</p>
                          
                        <h3>Validating the designs</h3>

                        <p>I conducted usability testing sessions with our primary users to validate whether the new designs would solve their problems. 
                     
                          Developing the designs
                          I created my high fidelity mockups in Sketch and then imported them into Invision to allow the engineers to inspect the file and export the HTML and CSS code.
                          I worked very closely with the Front End team to spec out any missing interactions that were not covered in the high fidelity mockups. I conducted a UX review of each front-end ticket that was implemented to ensure it was aligned with the designs before it went live.
                        </p>
                          
                          <p><h3>Results and takeaways</h3></p>
                          Since the implementation of the new rebuild of the Audience Wizard, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of complaints lodged through the service desk. Additionally, I have received positive feedback from users about the simplified configuration of their Audiences, saving them a large proportion of their time.
                         
                          <p>Some key takeaways from this project are:</p>
                          <p>Create a strategic plan to launch an MVP. This helps deal with out-of-scope requests that could potentially derail the project and helps deliver a quality product in time.
                          User testing doesn't end after development. Design is a constant iteration of improving the experience for the end user. Always find ways to collect and listen to your user's feedback.
                          Involve engineering upfront. This helps to reduce any rework later on as an understanding of the technical limitations upfront will help to inform your design strategy.
